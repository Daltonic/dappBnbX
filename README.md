![House Rental Marketplace](./screenshots/0.png)
The DappBnb project is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a rental marketplace where users can list, book, and review apartments. The project revolves around `DappBnb.sol`, a Solidity-written Ethereum smart contract. It leverages the OpenZeppelin library to ensure secure and standardized development of the contract.

The core of the contract is defined by three primary structures: `ApartmentStruct`, `BookingStruct`, and `ReviewStruct`, representing an apartment, a booking, and a review, respectively.

## Key Features

- `createAppartment`: Allows a user to create a new apartment listing.
- `updateAppartment`: Allows the apartment owner to update the details of an apartment.
- `deleteAppartment`: Allows the apartment owner to delete an apartment listing.
- `getApartments`: Allows a user to fetch all available apartments.
- `getApartment`: Allows a user to fetch the details of a specific apartment.
- `bookApartment`: Allows a user to book an apartment for specific dates.
- `checkInApartment`: Allows a tenant to check into an apartment and triggers the payment process.
- `claimFunds`: Allows the apartment owner to claim funds after a booking is completed.
- `refundBooking`: Allows a tenant to cancel a booking and get a refund.
- `getUnavailableDates`: Allows a user to fetch all booked dates for a specific apartment.

## Running the Application

Supply the following keys in your `.env` variable:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_ID=<YOUR_ALCHEMY_PROJECT_ID>
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=<WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=somereallysecretsecret
```

`YOUR_ALCHEMY_PROJECT_ID`: [Get Key Here](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/)
`WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: [Get Key Here](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in)

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. Install the package modules by running the command: `yarn install`
2. Start the Hardhat server: `yarn blockchain`
3. Run the contract deployment script: `yarn deploy`
4. Run the contract seeding script: `yarn seed`
5. Spin up the Next.js development server: `yarn dev`

Now, your application should be up and running.
